This code is forked from Drupal's Coder module.

SEE ALSO:
README_coder.txt, which is the README file for the upstream Coder
module.

BACKGROUND:
There are some issues with Coder module that make it hard to use
out-of-the-box for CiviCRM development.  Patches have been submitted
to Coder module, and the plan is that when those patches are committed,
this fork will become obsolte.

However, in the interest of providing a ready-to-go Coder module for
CiviCRM developers, I'm maintaining this fork with those patches
already applied.
